A helper library for the [Realex Payments](http://www.realexpayments.co.uk/) Realauth Redirect protocol. This is also used by [Global Iris](https://resourcecentre.globaliris.com/) and more documentation can be found there.

This is currently untested in a production environment, but hopefully will be soon.

Thanks to the [SagePayMvc](https://github.com/JeremySkinner/SagePayMvc) project for various ideas.
